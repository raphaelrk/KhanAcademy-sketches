# KhanAcademy Sketches
Repository holding the processing.js sketches I've made on https://www.khanacademy.org/profile/raphaelrk/programs

The organization of the programs here isn't the best - lots of programs are based on each other/inspired from each other, and some of these programs were made as far back as 2013, but the way I organized this doesn't show these things properly. The mix between old and new programs and clean and ugly programs might be apparent. But I tried to organize them by the type of program they are, and copy most of the programs on the khan academy page to this repository.
